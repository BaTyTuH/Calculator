The program was be developed in C++ language of C++17 standard on QT.
The program code was be located in the src folder.
Code follow google style and all classes implemented within the s21 namespace.
Was prepared full coverage of expression calculation modules with unit-tests using the GTest library.
The program can be built with Makefile which contains standard set of targets for GNU-programs: all, install, uninstall, clean, dvi, dist, tests.
The program was be implemented using the MVC pattern, and also
there hasn't business logic code in the view code, 
there hasn't interface code in the controller and the model 
and controllers is thin. 
You can provide the input of numbers in exponential notation.
The calculation start after you complete entering the calculating expression and press the = symbol.
Calculating arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation with substitution of the value of the variable x as a number.
You can plot a graph of a function given by an expression in infix notation with the variable x (with coordinate axes, mark of the used scale and an adaptive grid).
You can be able to enter up to 255 characters.
Bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation support the following arithmetic operations and mathematical functions:
+, -, (), *, /, ^, mod, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, sqrt, ln, log.
Support credit calculator.
